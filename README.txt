After seven months of training, I did an internship in a software development company. 

I have worked on a project that I presented in October 2023 for my certification. 

It is an internal project which has been started by other trainees before. 
I wrote an essay about it and what I have done. It's in the PDF file called Verhasselt_Nina_Dossier_Projet.pdf of this repository.

The front-end part is in React.js and styled components. 
The back-end is in Spring Boot.

I can't share the whole project, it belongs to the company but I shared few parts, as an example of the code I wrote.

I didn't study these technologies during my training, I tried to get familiar with React before the beginning of my internship.
It wasn't easy because we were studying PHP in the same time.  I hadn't any knowledge in Java before this.
